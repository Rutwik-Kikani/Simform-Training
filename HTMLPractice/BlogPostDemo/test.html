                Remember being a little kid, plopping down in front of the TV,
                carefully putting your headband on, making sure all your rubber
                kunai are in your pouch and getting ready to <b><em>“Believe it”?</em></b> Most
                kids probably didn’t go that far, but ninja hand signals were
                memorized and <b><em>"Rasengan!"</em></b> was shouted with gusto at playgrounds
                around the world.

                America, like many other countries caught Naruto Fever when the
                anime exploded on the scene. And it didn’t take long to
                transcend the world of otaku and hit the mainstream, something
                very few anime do. The secret of this show’s rare ability to
                cross cultural boundaries and demographics and become more
                popular than anyone imagined lies in its lovable characters,
                unique and stylish world, incredible storytelling and Sasuke,
                yeah, he’s just that cool.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="main-text">Haha, just kidding <em>Sasuke haters!</em></p>
              <br />
              <p class="main-text">
                The show’s success also lies in the strength of its main
                character, Naruto. His fierce loyalty to his friends, endless
                determination and unique ability to break through to enemies and
                show them there’s a better way resonated and inspired millions
                of fans across the world. And it still does to this day. Many
                kids felt like him, identified with him and learned from him.
